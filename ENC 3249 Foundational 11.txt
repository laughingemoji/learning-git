='"3 NEW IDEAS YOU CAN DO TO BRING LIFE BACK INTO YOUR YOUTH GROUP"'=

Every organization, not just temples and churches, depends on new 
members and an increasing rate of membership in order to stay alive.

Here are '"3 new, low cost ideas to improve the membership of your temple"':

=='"1.    Give a Warm Welcome to New Members"'==

We’ve all been there -- being a new member sucks, especially when you don’t 
know anybody. Looking around, everyone already has their friend group and 
seems to have this chemistry. They crack jokes you don’t understand and you 
end up sitting quietly in the corner waiting for the event to end.

This is not how a new member should feel. 

To make the first day experience less intimidating, '"welcome them with open 
arms"', do a mini '"ice breaker"', and give them a '"tour of the temple"'. 
They will be more at ease when they know about the environment. That’s what 
'"temple should be -- a second home"'.

=='"2.   Create a Youtube Channel/Stream services online"'==
Youtube is a bustling hub of content and is one of the '"most popular websites 
among youth"' today. It is '"guaranteed that anyone"' in the United States who has 
access to any of the following:
*Smartphone
*Desktop/Personal computer/ Laptop
*Smart Television
 to know what Youtube is.
​
This platform is beneficial to '"live stream Service and Dharma study sessions"' 
as a way for members who can’t regularly visit the temple an opportunity to 
be '"more exposed to Buddhism"'.

Youtube can also showcase some less serious moments of the youth group through 
'"vlogs"', or video blogs. Showing these everyday moments '"give potential 
members a taste of what they can expect"'.

==3.   Promote on Instagram and Facebook==
Facebook and Instagram are some of the top social media platforms with the 
highest population of users and visitors everyday. Growing the temple’s 
presence on these outlets is '"fast, easy and efficient"'. There is no need for 
professional editing, just a smartphone will do.

 It is the easiest way for members to '"show their friends what they’re involved 
in"'. In turn, those people who have seen your pages will be '"interested in 
joining since their friends are"'.
